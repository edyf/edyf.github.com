### TimeMachine, NAS, AirPlay Receiver and Internet Radio

For a while I wanted to build a Raspberry Pi Box that combines different useful functionalities.

### Parts needed

- Raspberry Pi
- USB sound card
- Ethernet cable
- Adafruit LCD + Keypad Pi Plate
- Powered USB hub
- External hard disk
- A box

### Setting up the Raspberry Pi

#### Internet

Since I'm using the RasPi Box as web server it has to connect with a static address.

Edit network configuration:

	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
	
Change the line:

	iface eth0 inet dhcp

to

	iface eth0 inet static

On the next line add the following (note: you will need your own addresses):

	address 192.168.192.110
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.192.0
	broadcast 192.168.192.255
	gateway 192.168.192.1

Then we'll need to reboot the Raspberry Pi

	sudo reboot


### Configure Raspberry Pi as TimeMachine

Install support for AFP filesystem

	sudo apt-get update	
	sudo apt-get install hfsplus hfsutils hfsprogs

Connect and mount the external hard disk

	sudo mount -o force /dev/sda1 /mnt/TimeMachine

Find the drive UUID

	sudo blkid
	
Automatically mount the hard drive on boot

	sudo mkdir /mnt/TimeMachine
	sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add a line to the end of the file with our Time Machine mounting preferences

	UUID="AAAA-BBBB..." /mnt/TimeMachine hfsplus rw,force,exec,auto,users 0 3
	
Where AAAA-BBBB... is the UUID of our drive.

Change all the data owner to user "pi" to make sure we will be able to backup in future:
	
	sudo chown -R pi /mnt/TimeMachine

Reboot

	sudo reboot

### Install and configure Avahi and Netatalk demons

The next step in order to use our Raspberry Pi as Time Machine we need to install Avahi and Netatalk
	
	sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev libdb5.3-dev db-util db5.3-util libgcrypt11 libgcrypt11-dev

Download, unpack and install Netatalk

	wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/netatalk/netatalk-3.1.1.tar.bz2
	
	tar -xvf netatalk-3.0.0.tar.bz2
	
	./configure --with-init-style=debian --with-zeroconf
	
	make
	
	sudo make install
